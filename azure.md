## Compute

### Identify & List services
Two categories are App Service and Azure Functions. 

### Service Description
App service, as described on the Microsoft website, lets you make  and launch your own web applications, as well as restful APIs and mobile back ends. An interesting feature of this this service is that it allows you the flexibility to choose any programming language and it can be deployed on Github, Azure DevOps and any repostiory on Github. It will automatically scale your applications and is a fully managed platform. Additionally, features include security, serverless code, and more. 

Azure Functions is a cloud infrastructure that allows a person who is writing code to connect to specific functions and keep their applications going. It can save time as well as money and Azure Functions can help to build web APIs and much more. 

###Python Interaction
For Azure App Service, any language you want can be used to to create and build your web apps, mobile back ends, and restfulAPIs. Python would be the language of interest here when building things in this sitation;
In the quickstart portion  on the Microsoft website, Flask or Django were examples are how Python can be used. Those are both python web applications, and App Service uses a Linux server envirornment that hosts the Python applications. 

For Azure functions the way that this relates to python is that the the code of choice is dependent on the user which allows for flexibility and ease of use. The code is up to the user and you would create code for your functions using Python which will then be deployed to the cloud in Azure. Visual Studion Code can be used to leverage this service and once the python extension is installed it can then be used to create Python functions.
